  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Klarna planned to launch a blog to share insights on e-commerce, fintech, and company culture while maintaining their distinctive brand voice.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    I designed a blog layout that balanced editorial needs with user experience, focusing on readability, content discovery, and alignment with Klarnaâ€™s visual identity.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Although the blog was fully designed, it was never launched. However, the process provided valuable insights into editorial design, content strategy, and brand consistency.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Not all projects go live, but the work still adds value. Designing for editorial content requires close alignment between content strategy, brand, and UX to ensure a seamless experience.
