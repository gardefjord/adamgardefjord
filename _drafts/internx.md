The objective of InternX was to provide value to both the employer and the student by providing highly qualified, pre-screened entry-level talent for the employer and providing on-ramps to 21st Century quality jobs for the student.

When I worked at [uLabs Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ulabs-ventures/about/), the goal was to create a service that could match talents (students) with employers internships. 

I was in charge of the UX Design, meaning I conducted interviews, did user-testing, sketching, created prototypes, etc.
