Trade Extension offered one of the most sophisticated tools to analyze data and optimize distribution, TESS. Still, it could take weeks of training to learn the platform for new users.

I lead a design team that worked closely with the client and end-users to create a unique user experience, flexible enough to cater to the vast array of functions, but still consistent enough to make the system more discoverable and more natural to grasp. I had the role of PM, Service Designer, and UX Designer – leading workshops, designing concepts, prototyping, set up design systems, interviews, and user tests.

Coupa acquired trade Extension[ in 2017 for 400M SEK](https://www.breakit.se/artikel/7235/trade-extensions-algoritmer-gor-upphandlingar-enkla-nu-kops-bolaget-for-400-miljoner) and renamed TESS to [Coupa Sourcing Optimization](https://www.coupa.com/products/strategic-sourcing/sourcing-optimization/).﻿
