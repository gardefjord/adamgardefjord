[Yrkesdörren](yrkesdörren.se) is an initiative from [Axfoundation](axfoundation.se), a non-profit business founded by Antonia Ax:son Johnson. Axdoundation aims to create the conditions for change towards a more sustainable society.

In collaboration with Axfoundation, I worked with a team at Ocean to develop the service [Yrkesdörren](https://yrkesdorren.se/sv/), a web-based matchmaking service with the purpose of quickly connect established and newly arrived Swedes to share and widen their professional networks. 

The goal of the overarching organization ÖppnaDörren is for Sweden to reduce the exclusion of newly arrived to Sweden and increase diversity. 

I was part of the explorative phase and helped shape the concept with the client. Ever since then, I have led the continued development of the service as a PM, UX Designer, and Front-End Developer.
