_Background_

In 2012 Digitaliseringskommissionen was assigned the task to reach the government's goals and ambitions within IT by Anna-Karin Hatt, the IT and Energy Minister of Sweden.

The Swedish government is actively working towards strengthening our digital society and enable citizens to take an active part in the digital transformation. Ocean supported the advisory committee on digitization to gather insights on citizens’ digital competences, to inform and guide national strategies.

Through in-depth interviews, our teams researched people's, motivations, behaviors, and attitudes towards digitization in their day-to-day life, and gathered our insights in an experience map. The visualization provides an accessible overview of digital competence in Sweden today and shows synergies between people’s ability, motivation, attitudes, and behaviors in different life situations. The map got published in the report [Gör Sverige i framtiden, Delbetänkande av Digitaliseringskommissionen, 2015]().

_What I did_

I planned and facilitated about ten phone interviews and five in-person interviews. I structured, mapped, and analyzed the data and sketch out different types of visualizations that were then finalized together with a visual designer.
