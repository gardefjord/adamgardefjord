Vem? or "Who?" as you would say in English is an adaptation of Stina Wirsens kid books series with the same name. Stina Wirsén is one of Swedens most prominent kids books author and illustrator. 

The app was also translated and released in German, Norwegian and English. 

The app was created in an existing platform and I was in charge of both the tech-part as well as the adaptation of the books on to the platform.
