  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Social services interactions can be complex and overwhelming for citizens. The existing systems and processes were often unclear, leading to confusion for those seeking support.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We researched how citizens and social service workers interact with the current system. Through interviews and testing, we identified pain points and explored ways to make the processes more accessible. The focus was on clear communication that would work for everyone involved.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The Kollen prototype showed potential ways to make social services more transparent and easier to navigate. We explored how clearer communication could help both citizens and social workers in their daily interactions.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    When designing for social services, emotional considerations are just as important as functional ones. However, the most crucial lesson was about impact: to create real change, you need to understand where your work fits into the broader organizational strategy. Despite our dedication, we learned that ultimate implementation often lies beyond the design team's control. Make sure to contribute value as much and as often as possible, that is the work.
