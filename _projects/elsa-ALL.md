  <div class="grid-content">
    Navigating the healthcare journey can be overwhelming and unclear for many patients. This project aimed to map the patient experience, pinpoint critical pain points, and uncover insights that could guide future improvements.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    To build a comprehensive understanding, we conducted interviews with patients and healthcare providers, identifying key emotional, logistical, and systemic challenges. These insights were visualized in a detailed journey map created in Figma. The map highlighted moments of friction and opportunities for better support, serving as a tool for the client to deepen their understanding of the patient journey.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The journey map provided Celgene with valuable insights and a clear picture of the patient journey, fostering a greater understanding among healthcare providers of patient needs and challenges. While the project didn’t lead directly to further work exploring how digital tools might ease the patient journey—a step we often take—it equipped Celgene with a strong foundation for future initiatives. The client was impressed by how much we accomplished using our methods and praised the map for its depth and clarity.

    This project highlighted the importance of using design as a way to generate insights and understanding. By focusing on the patient’s perspective, we were able to create a resource that not only shed light on their challenges but also helped Celgene empathize and strategize effectively.
