<div class="project-grid">
  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    With many Swedish companies hiring through personal networks, foreign-born professionals face major barriers to entering the job market. This gap slows integration and economic growth.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We mimicked the real service in early user research, recording test meetings and conducting immediate follow-up interviews. This gave us a deep understanding of user behavior from the start, making the design process smoother. Using these insights, we iteratively built a platform that made it simple and rewarding for professionals to share their networks.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The platform has facilitated over 10,000 professional connections, bridging the networking gap and helping newcomers gain workplace insights and confidence. Today, <a href="https://yrkesdorren.se" target="_blank">Yrkesdörren</a> is part of <a href="https://www.axfoundation.se/projekt/axelerate" target="_blank">Axelerate</a>, <a href="https://www.axeljohnson.se/en/" target="_blank">Axel Johnson's</a> broader diversity and inclusion program.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Early, real-world user testing is invaluable. Validating hypotheses quickly and deeply understanding user behavior from the start makes the entire design process more focused and effective. When research closely reflects reality, the solutions practically design themselves.
