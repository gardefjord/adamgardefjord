  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    With lots of Swedish companies recruiting through personal networks, foreign-born professionals face significant barriers entering the job market. This creates a gap between established Swedes and newcomers, slowing integration and economic growth.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We designed a platform that facilitates meaningful professional connections. Through user research and iterative design, we created an experience that makes it easy and rewarding for established professionals to share their network and industry knowledge with newcomers.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The platform successfully bridges the networking gap, enabling knowledge exchange and expanding professional networks. Since launch, it has facilitated over 10,000 meaningful professional connections. For newcomers, these meetings provide valuable insights into workplace culture and boost confidence in the job market. The initiative has become part of Axelerate, Axel Johnson's broader diversity and inclusion program.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Integration happens through relationships, and relationships are built through meetings. Digital platforms can facilitate these connections, but the human element - making it easy and meaningful for people to help others - is key to success.
