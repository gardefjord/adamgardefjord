  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Remote eye tracking studies were complex to set up and manage, requiring significant technical expertise. Tobii needed to understand the complete user journey and identify opportunities to make their technology more accessible to researchers while ensuring ease of participation for study subjects.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We structured the initial exploration as two focused design sprints, each including four collaborative workshops with Tobii's product team. Using customer journey mapping as our framework, we gained a shared understanding of the complete eye tracking study process. These insights then guided our prototyping and testing phase, where we worked closely with the Tobii team to transform opportunities into concrete solutions.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The sprint-based approach led to clear insights that shaped GazeShare's development. The resulting service streamlined critical workflows like equipment calibration, participant onboarding, and session recording. What began as exploratory design sprints evolved into a full product that makes remote eye tracking studies more accessible while maintaining the technical rigor researchers require.

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Starting with focused design sprints helped build a strong foundation of user understanding before moving into solution development. The collaborative approach with Tobii's team ensured we maintained the right balance between simplifying complex processes and preserving necessary technical sophistication.
