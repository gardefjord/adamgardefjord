  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Setting up remote eye tracking studies was complex and required technical expertise. Tobii wanted to make the process easier for researchers and participants, especially as eye tracking became a tool in UX research, making me both a designer and a user.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Initially, through interviews and workshops we created a customer journey mapping to identify key pain points. Later, we ran two design sprints with Tobii's team to prototype and test solutions.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The work led to GazeShare, a service that simplified equipment calibration, participant onboarding, and session recording. What began as a concept evolved into a full product that made remote eye tracking more accessible while maintaining research-grade accuracy.

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Using the product myself gave me quick insights but also showed the bias of personal experience. This project reinforced the need to balance firsthand knowledge with diverse user perspectives to avoid designing only for oneself.
