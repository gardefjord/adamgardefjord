  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Through extensive user research with both students and employers, we identified key pain points in the internship search process. The project culminated in an intensive three-week sprint in San Diego, where we rapidly prototyped and tested solutions with real users.
