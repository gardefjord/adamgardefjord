  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <a href="https://www.oppnadorren.se" target="_blank">ÖppnaDörren</a> was launching as an Axfoundation initiative, uniting several integration programs under one brand. They needed a platform that clearly communicated their mission and seamlessly connected users to the right program based on their situation.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Collaborating with Axfoundation and <a href="https://www.fb.se" target="_blank">Forsman & Bodenfors</a>, we designed and built a site that blended storytelling with intuitive navigation. With tight timelines and multiple stakeholders, we ensured the platform launched smoothly alongside the campaign film while guiding users to relevant resources.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The platform introduced ÖppnaDörren to the public and facilitated thousands of meaningful connections. It successfully unified different integration programs under one umbrella while making it easy for users to engage. A testament to our work: the site still looks and functions much like it did at launch in 2015, proving the strength of its design and usability.

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Coordinating multiple stakeholders while aligning with a campaign requires clear priorities and sharp communication. Designing for a broad audience reinforced the power of simplicity, accessibility, and collaboration in making meaningful connections happen.
