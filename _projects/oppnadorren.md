  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Axfoundation was launching ÖppnaDörren, an initiative to unite several integration programs under one umbrella. They needed a platform that would effectively communicate their mission and connect users to the right program based on their situation and interests.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Working alongside Axfoundation and their campaign partner Forsman & Bodenfors, we designed and built a site that combined storytelling with intuitive functionality. Despite tight timelines and multiple stakeholders, we delivered a platform that guided users to relevant resources while launching seamlessly with the campaign film.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The launch platform effectively introduced ÖppnaDörren to the public and facilitated thousands of meaningful connections. It successfully united different integration programs under one brand while making it easy for users to find the right program for their needs. I'm immensely proud to have been part of an initiative that continues to make a real difference in fostering integration in Swedish society.
