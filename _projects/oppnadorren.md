  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <a href="https://www.oppnadorren.se/">ÖppnaDörren</a> needed a platform to unite several organizations under a shared mission: opening doors to Swedish society for newcomers. The site had to combine a strong, clear message with functionality to connect users to partner organizations based on their needs and interests, while appealing to a broad audience.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Working alongside ÖppnaDörren and their campaign partner Forsman & Bodenfors, we designed and built a site that combined storytelling with intuitive functionality. Despite tight timelines and multiple stakeholders, we delivered a platform that guided users to relevant resources while launching seamlessly with the campaign film.

    The site effectively communicated ÖppnaDörren’s mission and facilitated thousands of meaningful connections. It remains a valuable tool for promoting integration in Sweden, demonstrating the impact of thoughtful design and strong collaboration.
