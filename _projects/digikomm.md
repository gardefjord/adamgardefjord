  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Sweden lacked a clear understanding of digital competence across different demographics. There was no holistic picture of how people engaged with digital tools, their confidence levels, or their motivations. This knowledge gap made it difficult to design effective policy and education initiatives.

  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We conducted in-depth interviews with individuals from diverse backgrounds—varying in age, education, profession, and digital experience. The research focused on understanding attitudes, skills, and behaviors related to digital services, as well as identifying key barriers to digital adoption. By visualizing these insights, we provided a structured understanding of Sweden's digital landscape.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The project delivered a nuanced map of digital competence in Sweden, highlighting differences in confidence, digital literacy, and usage patterns across demographics. These insights informed policy recommendations and helped shape future digital education initiatives. The research also identified societal expectations around digitalization and the challenges some groups face in keeping up with technological advancements.

    <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Digital competence is more than technical skill—it encompasses confidence, motivation, and attitudes toward technology. The research underscored the importance of personalized approaches to digital education, acknowledging that different groups experience digitalization in vastly different ways.
