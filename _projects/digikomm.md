  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The Digitaliseringskommissionen needed a clearer picture of digital competence across demographics to inform policy and education initiatives.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    I conducted interviews across diverse groups to explore digital skills, attitudes, and barriers. Visualizing these insights provided a structured view of Sweden’s digital landscape.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The research mapped digital confidence, literacy, and usage patterns, shaping policy recommendations and digital education strategies while identifying societal expectations and challenges.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Digital competence goes beyond technical skills—it includes confidence and motivation. Tailored education approaches are key, as different groups experience digitalization differently.
