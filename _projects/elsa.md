  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Patients with chronic conditions face multiple challenges: tracking complex medication regimens, identifying symptom patterns, establishing baselines, and maintaining sustainable routines. With healthcare provider visits being infrequent, it was nearly impossible for patients to accurately remember and share how they'd been doing since their last appointment. The existing tools were fragmented and difficult to use, making it harder for patients to manage their condition effectively and communicate their experiences to their healthcare providers.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>We tackled this complex challenge through several interconnected initiatives:</p>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>Simplified the navigation system to improve access to key features</li>
      <li>Created an intuitive weekly summary view for tracking health patterns</li>
      <li>Redesigned medication management for better tracking and adherence</li>
      <li>Developed comprehensive history views for long-term insights</li>
      <li>Built a baseline tracking system for Crohn's Disease patients</li>
      <li>Created a "New Normal" program to help establish sustainable routines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each initiative involved extensive user research, iterative design, and testing with patients and healthcare providers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>The redesigned platform significantly improved patient engagement and health tracking capabilities:</p>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>Simplified navigation increased regular app usage</li>
      <li>Weekly summaries enabled better pattern recognition</li>
      <li>Improved medication tracking led to better adherence</li>
      <li>History views facilitated more informed healthcare discussions</li>
      <li>Baseline tracking helped patients understand their condition progression</li>
      <li>The New Normal program helped establish sustainable routines</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Complex healthcare challenges require a holistic approach. While each feature serves a specific purpose, their true value comes from how they work together to support patients' overall health management journey. Regular user testing and close collaboration with healthcare providers were crucial to creating tools that truly serve patient needs.
