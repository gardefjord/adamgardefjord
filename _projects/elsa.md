<div class="project-grid">
  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Managing chronic conditions is complex—patients struggle to track symptoms, medications, and routines, making healthcare visits less effective. Existing tools were fragmented and unintuitive, limiting engagement and real-world impact.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We worked in rapid sprints, launching updates every three weeks—uncommon in healthcare. UX had to fit this pace, ensuring continuous feedback loops through user testing. We introduced new tools, monitored adoption, and iterated based on real-world patient needs.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Frequent iterations led to tangible improvements in engagement and usability:
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>70-85% retention in the self-care app, showing strong user adoption.</li>
      <li>Simplified health tracking improved patient confidence and decision-making.</li>
      <li>Clinical Dashboard enabled earlier interventions, reducing unnecessary visits by 34%.</li>
      <li>Self-Screening Tool, tested on 40,000 users, improved clarity in diagnosis journeys.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>Being fully embedded in a product team for the first time taught me how product decisions shape teams, strategy, and user impact. I saw firsthand how product-market fit evolves and how empowered teams drive better outcomes.</p>

    <p>Working in B2B2C healthcare, I learned to design for multiple stakeholders—building tools for users who would, in turn, create experiences for their own users. Each feature had to be valuable at different levels.</p>

    <p>I also saw that startups go through phases, each requiring different skills. Sometimes big changes were needed, not just small improvements. The key was staying flexible, experimenting, and adapting quickly.</p>
