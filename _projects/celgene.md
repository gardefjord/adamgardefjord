  <div class="grid-content">
    Navigating the healthcare journey can be overwhelming and unclear for many patients living with MS (Multiple sclerosis). This project aimed to map the patient experience, pinpoint critical pain points, and uncover insights that could guide future improvements. 
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    To build a comprehensive understanding, we conducted contextual interviews with patients and healthcare providers. After analysis the insights were visualized and mapped on a detailed journey map. The map highlighted moments of friction and opportunities for better support, serving as a tool for the client to deepen their understanding.

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The journey map provided Celgene with valuable insights and a clear picture of the patient journey, fostering a greater understanding among healthcare providers of patient needs and challenges. While the project didn’t lead directly to further work exploring how digital tools might ease the patient journey—a step we often take—it equipped Celgene with a strong foundation for future initiatives. The client was impressed by how much we accomplished using our methods and praised the map for its depth and clarity.

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    This project underscored the power of design as a tool for generating deep insights and understanding. By centering the patient’s perspective, we created a resource that not only illuminated their challenges but also enabled Celgene to empathize and strategize more effectively. I still remember their surprise at how much detail we uncovered in such a short time.
