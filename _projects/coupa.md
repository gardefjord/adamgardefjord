  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    After acquiring TradeExtensions, Coupa needed to integrate complex sourcing functionality while maintaining usability for enterprise procurement teams.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We conducted extensive user research with procurement professionals to understand their workflows and pain points. Through iterative design and testing, we simplified complex sourcing processes while building a comprehensive design system to ensure consistency across the platform. Regular user testing sessions validated our solutions and informed refinements.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The redesigned platform successfully merged TradeExtensions' powerful sourcing capabilities with Coupa's user-friendly interface. The new design system enabled faster development and consistent experiences across products, while improved navigation and workflows increased user efficiency.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Enterprise software can be both powerful and intuitive when designed with user needs at the forefront. Regular user testing and a systematic approach to design helped us manage complexity while improving usability.
