  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    TradeExtensions had a powerful but outdated tool with poor usability, requiring expert knowledge and a long onboarding period. The challenge was to modernize the platform while preserving its complexity for experienced users.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We conducted in-depth user research, including card sorting workshops with customers, to identify key pain points. Through iterative design sprints, we restructured navigation and improved usability while maintaining the system’s depth. A parallel track focused on developing a new, streamlined version of the platform.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The redesigned platform improved navigation and onboarding without sacrificing functionality. Shortly after, TradeExtensions was acquired by Coupa for $45 million, and we supported the rebranding and integration into Coupa’s ecosystem.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Balancing complexity with usability is key in enterprise software. Structured research and iterative design ensured improvements were both impactful and widely adopted.
