  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    TradeExtensions had a powerful but outdated tool with poor usability, requiring expert knowledge and a long onboarding period. The challenge was to modernize the platform while preserving its complexity for experienced users.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
  Leading Trade Extensions’ in-house design team, I worked with Electrolux, IKEA, Volvo, Johnson & Johnson, and Kimberly-Clark. Through card sorting workshops, we mapped key system areas, then ran 40+ design sprints to redesign them—adding new features, refining workflows, and ensuring scalability with a structured design system.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The transformation made the platform accessible to a broader audience. New features lowered the barrier for entry, helping less experienced users get value faster. The structured design system enabled scalable improvements without compromising complexity. The impact was clear: shortly after, TradeExtensions was acquired by Coupa for $45 million, and I supported its integration.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Redesigning large systems works best in small, focused iterations—never in one massive overhaul. Improving usability not only enhances the experience for existing users but also opens doors to entirely new markets.
