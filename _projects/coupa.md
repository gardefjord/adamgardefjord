  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    TradeExtensions had a powerful but outdated tool with poor usability, requiring expert knowledge and a long onboarding period. The challenge was to modernize the platform while preserving its complexity for experienced users.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    We started with card sorting workshops to identify key issues, then ran 40+ design sprints to iteratively introduce features, refine workflows, and streamline onboarding. A design system ensured consistency and scalability as the platform evolved.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The transformation made the platform accessible to a broader audience. New features lowered the barrier for entry, helping less experienced users get value faster. The structured design system enabled scalable improvements without compromising complexity. The impact was clear: shortly after, TradeExtensions was acquired by Coupa for $45 million, and we supported its integration.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Redesigning large systems works best in small, focused iterationsâ€”never in one massive overhaul. Improving usability not only enhances the experience for existing users but also opens doors to entirely new markets.
