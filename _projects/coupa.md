    The Coupa Sourcing Optimization (CSO) platform, while powerful, faced challenges with usability and navigation. Many users struggled to find what they needed, understand the structure, and use the platform efficiently. The system needed to balance retaining its flexibility while becoming more intuitive and accessible to a broader user base.

    We started by conducting extensive user research, including interviews, usability testing, and workshops, to uncover key pain points and opportunities. Collaborative ideation sessions with the development team in Uppsala and sourcing experts worldwide helped us define solutions. Through over 40 design sprints and iterations of wireframes and prototypes, we refined navigation, simplified workflows, and modernized the design system to align with Coupa's branding guidelines. Regular user feedback ensured that improvements resonated with their needs.
