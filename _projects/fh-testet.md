  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is often undiagnosed until a major health event. At first, we didn't know what problem to solve—our goal was to find the key barriers to early detection and treatment.
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Through workshops with patients and healthcare professionals, we discovered a major gap: awareness and emotional support. Many didn't recognize their risk, and diagnosed patients felt lost. We designed a self-assessment tool that made the first step clear, simple, and reassuring.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    The FH-testet sparked action. In two months, 13,000 people visited, 2,300 completed the test, and 100 sought specialist care. The project proved digital tools can drive real healthcare impact.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    Taking time to find the real problem is key. Smaller, focused interventions often make the biggest difference—especially when they turn complex issues into something actionable.
