  <div class="grid-headline">Problem</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>Sweden's largest healthcare regions needed a unified strategy for digital patient information. The goal was to map patient journeys, highlight pain points, and define a vision for better care.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-headline">Approach</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>I conducted collaborative workshops with patients, experts, and healthcare professionals. Together, we mapped out 10 key scenarios, capturing real experiences and challenges. This work resulted in both current-state and future-state journeys to guide system improvements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Outcomes</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>The project delivered 20 detailed patient journeys, offering a clear roadmap for digital transformation. It highlighted critical needs for improved communication, system integration, and patient-centered care solutions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-headline">Lessons Learned</div>
  <div class="grid-content">
    <p>Large-scale projects with multiple stakeholders are slow, time-consuming, and often over-documented. The scope was too broadâ€”splitting it into smaller, focused teams would have been more effective. A leaner approach would have yielded faster, more actionable insights.</p>
